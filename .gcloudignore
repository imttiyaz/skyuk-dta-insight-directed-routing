# This file specifies files that are *not* uploaded to Google Cloud Platform
# using gcloud. It follows the same syntax as .gitignore, with the addition of
# "#!include" directives (which insert the entries of the given .gitignore-style
# file at that point).
#
# For more information, run:
#   $ gcloud topic gcloudignore

# ignore this gcloudignore file
.gcloudignore

# ignore this file to ensure that during deployment npm install is used by default to install dependencies
yarn.lock

# If you would like to upload your .git directory, .gitignore file or files
# from your .gitignore file, remove the corresponding line
# below:
.git
.gitignore
#!include:.gitignore

# ignore the README.md file
README.md
